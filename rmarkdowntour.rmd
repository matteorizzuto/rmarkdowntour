# Philosophy

## What is writing?
```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("writing1.png")
```

## What is writing?
```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("writing2.png")
```

## What is writing?
```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("writing3.png")
```

## What is writing? {.build}

Really, all three. Software-wise, this translates into two main schools:

- **WYSIWYG**--_What You See Is What You Get_: word processing software, e.g. Microsoft Word^1^

- **WISIWIT**--_What I See Is What I Type_: typesetting software, e.g. LaTeX^1^

knitr::include_graphics("feelings.gif")
```

# What is R Markdown?

## What is R Markdown? {.build}

R Markdown is a file format for making **dynamic documents** with R. 
An R Markdown document is written in markdown and contains chunks of embedded code.

Ok, what's markdown? 

Markdown^2^ is a **plain text** formatting syntax: you can read markdown in its source format and still understand it (in fact, you are doing just that).

# Why R Markdown?

## Why R Markdown?

<div class="columns-2">
Practical reasons

- Simple
- Powerful
- Transferable
- Versatile
- Free

Philosophical reasons

- WYSIWYG vs. WISIWIT
- Let's you focus on the writing
- Open
- Transparent
- Version Control

# R Markdown Basics

## Installation

If you installed RStudio, congrats! You're all set to start using R Markdown.

If you prefer to not use RStudio, make sure to install the `rmarkdown` package.

In either case, make sure to install the `tinytex` package, which will let you 
export your work as PDF.

## Anatomy of an R Markdown document {.build}

An R Markdown document (.Rmd) has three main components: metadata, text, and code. 

- Metadata go at the very top of you file, written using YAML
- You write your text as if you were writing in Notepad/TextEdit
- For code chunks, you will need to
    + open the chunk
    + specify the chunk's code language and options
    + write your code inside the chunk
    + close the chunk

Let's look at all these operations together. Let me open a real R Markdown 
notebook.
