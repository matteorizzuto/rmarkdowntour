# Philosophy

## What is writing?
```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("writing1.png")
```

## What is writing?
```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("writing2.png")
```

## What is writing?
```{r echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("writing3.png")
```

## What is writing? {.build}

Really, all three. Software-wise, this translates into two main schools:

- **WYSIWYG**--_What You See Is What You Get_: word processing software, e.g. Microsoft Word^1^

- **WISIWIT**--_What I See Is What I Type_: typesetting software, e.g. LaTeX^1^

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center',out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("feelings.gif")
```

# What is R Markdown?

## What is R Markdown? {.build}

R Markdown is a file format for making **dynamic documents** with R. 
An R Markdown document is written in markdown and contains chunks of embedded code.

Ok, what's markdown? 

Markdown^2^ is a **plain text** formatting syntax: you can read markdown in its source format and still understand it (in fact, you are doing just that).

# Why R Markdown?

## Why R Markdown?

<div class="columns-2">
Practical reasons

- Simple
- Powerful
- Transferable
- Adaptable
- Version Control
- Free

Philosophical reasons

- WYSIWYG vs. WISIWIT
- Let's you focus on the writing
- Open
- Transparent
- Stable

# R Markdown Basics

## {data-background=foo.png data-background-size=cover}



```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown presentation. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.
