# Basics

## Text and Code

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

Ok, let's pause a second a talk about chunks. We've just run an R chunk. We did this by **opening** the chunk with ```` ``` ````, writing `{r}` after the three backticks that open the chunk, then wrote our code, and finally **closed** the chunk with ```` ``` ````. 

Remember, be a

```{r rmarkdown-codehero, echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width="35%",fig.cap="Artwork by [\\@allison_horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations), [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/matteo/stats-illustrations/rstats-artwork/code_hero.gif")
```

We can also set a number of options in this way. To set options, you write `[option name]=[value]` after writing ```` ```{r} ```` Some popular options:

- `include`, should the chunk be part of the output or not? [`TRUE` or `FALSE`]
- `echo`, to show or hide the code in the output [`TRUE` or `FALSE`]
- `tidyr`, to tidy the appearance of the code in the output [`TRUE` or `FALSE`]

You can find **all** rmarkdown code chunk options in this [handy pdf cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), alongside a description of what values they can take and what do they do to your code.

## Including Plots and Figure

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

What if I add two plots in the same chunk? 

```{r pressure-two, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
title(main = "A classic plot")

ggplot(data=pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("A fancier plot") + theme_classic()
``` 

And what about including an external image?

```{r rmarkdown-rollercoaster, echo=TRUE,fig.align='center',fig.cap="Artwork by [\\@allison_horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations), [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)"}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/matteo/stats-illustrations/rstats-artwork/r_rollercoaster.png")
```

## What about Tables and data frames?


Well, that depends. If it is a simple table, you can just 
type it out. For instance:

Variable       Description                                   Units     Range
-------------  --------------------------------------------- --------- -----
N~i~           Nutrients stocks in patch _i_                 g         >0
P~i~           Producers stocks in patch _i_                 g         >0
C~i~           Consumers stocks in patch _i_                 g         >0
-------------  --------------------------------------------- --------- -----

Of course, just as you can embed plots, you can also embed more complex tables 
and data frames:

```{r table, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
pressure
```

Or, to be a bit fancier, one can use function `kable` and 
the `kableExtra` package:

```{r kabled-table, echo=TRUE, tidy=TRUE}
library(kableExtra)

kable(pressure) %>% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), fixed_thead = TRUE) %>% scroll_box(width = "100%", height = "150px")
```

## References and Bibliographies {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Alright, you got your code, you got your text, your got your 
fancy swanky plots. However, we all know it's not a real piece 
of scientific writing if there is not at least one `however` and 
several references (and a double negative, if you're Anne).

So, references. R Markdown relies on a similarly plain-text format to deal with these: BibTeX. Essentially, the workflow is this:

### Step 1
You create a text file, save it with `.bib` extension in the same directory as your `.Rmd` file

### Step 2 
Start populating it with citations: all journals/search engines 
allow you to export BibTeX formatted citations, and several free 
pieces of software exist to help you manage them (I prefer to do 
it by hand). 

A typical BibTex entry looks like this:

```
@article{allaire2018,
  title={rmarkdown: Dynamic Documents for R},
  author={Allaire, J and Xie, Yihui and McPherson, Jonathan and Luraschi, Javier and Ushey, Kevin and Atkins, Aron and Wickham, Hadley and Cheng, Joe and Chang, Winston and Iannone, Richard},
  journal={R package version},
  volume={1},
  number={11},
  year={2018}
}
```

### Step 3

Now come back to your R Markdown document. We need to tell R 
Markdown that we have a bibliography file (`.bib`), that we want 
R Markdown to use it when we will hit the **Knit** button, and 
that some of the words in our text are going to be references. 
How do we do all this? 

First things first. We go back to the YAML metadata at the very 
top and we add this new item to the list of options:

```
bibliography: rmarkdowntourbibliography.bib
```

This tells R Markdown two things: (i) that we are going to 
insert references in the text we are going to write and (ii) 
that when we hit **Knit**, we want R Markdown to go look for 
that `.bib` file to find the references.

Now, to add the references to the text itself. 

### Step 4

Whenever and wherever you'd like to add a citation, you type
``` [@citationkey] ```. `citationkey` is BibTeX code, and it is 
a unique identifier for each item in a `.bib` file.

Using the reference I showed you above, I type ``` [@allaire2018] ``` and it produces [@allaire2018]. If you scroll to the bottom, 
you'll find a complete citation for it.

Now, R Markdown is smart but not \*that\* smart, so it will not 
create a section header for your 
references/bibliography/literature cited section. Don't forget 
to add it yourself at the very end of your document!

## Writing, Running, Knitting... what?

Alright, well, now that we've done all this stuff, it would be 
nice to see the final product, wouldn't it?

Getting to the cool-looking HTML output is easy-peasy: look at 
the top of this tab. You'll see a little icon showing a blue 
yarn stabbed by a needles, with the label "Knit" next to it.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated 
that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded 
R code chunks within the document.
