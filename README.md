This repository contains my materials for the R Markdown tour I will present during the January 26, 2021, Leroux Lab meeting. It contains:

- rmarkdowntour.html, the presentation that I showed during the lab meeting, this is an HTMl file and will open in your browser
- rmarkdowntour.Rmd, the R markdown document that produces the rmarkdowntour.html presentation
- rmarkdownsample.html, a html notebook with the 'type-along' stuff I showed you during the hands-on part of the lab meeting
- rmarkdownsample.Rmd, the R markdown document that produces the rmarkdownsample.html file
- style.css, a CSS file that changes some of the default formatting options for the rmarkdowntour.html presentation
- rmarkdowntourbibliography.bib, a BibTeX file that contains a couple of example references to use in the rmarkdownsample.Rmd file
- rmarkdowntour.Rproj, a RStudio Project file that contains all the above

I have not included the images and gifs I used in the presentation in this online repository, as I do not own the copyright for those. The links in the rmarkdowntour.Rmd file should allow you to track them down on the internet. 

Feel free to download/fork this repository and play with the materials it.
